## Plant Game

Just a simple gardening game. Drag and drop seeds, Shiggy your plants, Death your rewards, repeat.
Its pretty crappy since its my first project with JS, CSS and HTML, but it works fine.
Could be polished, probably wont get around to.

To play (which is not adwised) just clone the repositiory and open the index.html file in the browser of your choosing. 
(at least i hope. didnt actually test any other browser than firefox)
